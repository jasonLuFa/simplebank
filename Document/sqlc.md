# ðŸ’» Sqlc
- Writing the CRUD
- Why to use sqlc instead of GORM, SQLX ?
  1. learning how to write sql (GORM must learn to write queries using gorm's funnction )
  2. very fast & easy to use ( GORM run slowly on high load )
  3. Automatic code generation
  4. Catch SQL query errors before generating codes ( SQLX won't occur error util runtime )
